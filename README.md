# three-js-living-room
A little snip of code to play around with Three.js

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. From the terminal in the project directory, type 
```
npm i
node server
```
3. In the browser, navigate to *http://localhost:3000*

Use the mouse to move around! I hope to use this as a sandbox app to learn more about Three and WebGL at large.
